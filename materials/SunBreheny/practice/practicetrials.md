* **(TO MAKE THE PRACTICE TRIALS:)** 
    There are six set practice trials, and each of the six practice trials would need 5 “slides” per trial. There is no indication anywhere in the paper or in the materials that they sent us that the order of the 6 trials was ever randomized, and I think they stayed in a very specific order => At the beginning of practice trial 1, the participant heard a scenario, and this same scenario applied to practice trial 2. Then the same for practice trials 3&4 and 5&6. 
	    **(Slide 1 Visual)**: Image of just [figure] 
            **(Slide 1 script)**: “This is [figure]. [He/she] gives out fruit to children everyday.”
	    **(Slide 2 Visual)**: Image of [figure] on the left, and on the right, their objects organized horizontally by display type (I.e. 33-33 or 44-22 - Sun explains physically what a 33-33 and a 44-22 display would look like in the email)  
            **(Slide 2 Script)**: Here is what [he/she] has on [Monday/Tuesday]. [He/she] has [object 1, object 2, object 3, object 4]. [He/she] always brings more than enough. The leftover [object(s)] are put in the middle. 
	    **(Slide 3 Visual)** : Same display format as exp. trials. 
            **(Script)**: Click on the [gender] that has [determiner] of [Name’s] [object(s)]. 
	    **(Slide 4 Visual)**: Repeat slide 2 with same figure & story but different display type (33-33 or 44-22) 
	        **(Slide 5 Visual)**: Repeat slide 3 with  same figure and story but different display (but same display format as exp. trials.)
    Repeat slides 1-5 for each of the remaining 2 figures. 

They gave us a spreadsheet with all the necessary info that we would need to create the practice trials, like the figure that belongs in each of the six trials, what objects should be used, their locations in slides 3 and 5, and the target and competitor locations, the determiner used, etc. However, it seems to me like they have it organized in a different order than the way they sent the exp. trial info, and possibly some duplicate columns. Looking at what they gave us, I cant imagine us needing any other materials. We would need to make the 33-33 or 44-22 displays for slides 2 and 4, but because there are only 6 of them total, I could put them together in photoshop to make the HTML code easier (so we would need to code for only 2 images to appear next to each other instead of 13 in varying sizes and locations). 

I have added the excel file of each of the 6 practice trial stimuli and the example practice trial texts that they sent us into eyetacking_replication/experiments/simple_exp/materials. In "practice text" I have added what "slide" each text instruciton would go with. 

**(Practice Trial Question:)**
     #1Along with the experimental trials, do we want to first create the practice trials online, (text instructions) and then make it audio later?
