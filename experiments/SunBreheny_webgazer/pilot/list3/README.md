# Plan (updated on March 12)
* make images clickable
* fix formatting of the display (Leyla - Monday)
* images or locations should be clickable? (Madigan - Monday) (Leyla - Monday makes images clickable)
	* fix log_responses to save the location and stimuli info - this exp. logs the stimuli from list #3 that they gave us - when we make the other two exps. we will have to change the last 3 stimuli responses that get logged bc they are titled based off of what list they come from. (MB 3/12)
* make it an incremental decision task (Leyla)
	* how much to reveal with every click?
	* how to slice the instruction
	* save every click in same instance with diff variable
* incorporating eyetracking stuff
* how did Sun and Brehnny look at eye tracking data
